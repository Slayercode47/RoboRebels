                Moth orchids, native only to the tropical regions of Asia and Australia, are mostly known for brightening up the indoor spaces of homes in the U.S. In fact, these exotic flowers are almost impossible to grow outdoors anywhere in continental North America.

            <div id="mylight" style="border: 1px solid black; font-size: 18px; display: none;">Good lighting is required to grow Phalaenopsis, but direct sunlight will scorch the leaves. During the winter, however, you can place the orchid in a south-facing or east-facing window that gets some direct light. Rotate your orchid from time to time to keep its growth even. A plant with proper lighting will produce light green leaves. Too little light will result in dark green leaves, and too much light will cause a pink or reddish tinge to develop along leaf margins, which will eventually turn yellow.

            <div id="mysoil" style="border: 1px solid black; font-size: 18px; display: none;">
                If there is not sufficient natural light, you can also position the plant under supplemental grow lights. The lights of choice for orchids are fluorescent tubes (40 or 74 watts depending on length), and locate the Phalaenopsis 12 inches underneath the light.

            <div id="mywater" style="border: 1px solid black; font-size: 18px; display: none;">
                Phalaenopsis is considered a "warm houseplant" and prefers temperatures between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Still, they can adapt to normal house temperatures of 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The higher the temperature, the greater the plant's need for humidity, and the higher the humidity and temperature, the greater the need for turbulent airflow to prevent rot, fungus, and disease. Many successful orchid growers run a ceiling fan or stationary fan constantly in rooms where they grow orchids.
                Orchids also like contrasting night and day temperatures. To induce a flower spike, the plant needs a few cooler nights, with temperatures around 55 F, in order to bloom.

            <div id="myfertilizer" style="border: 1px solid black; font-size: 18px; display: none;">
                Moth is a "monopodial" orchid, which means that it grows from a single stem. It does not have the large water-storing pseudobulbs found on sympodial (or branching) orchids, hence, this plant has a lower tolerance for drought. During the growing season, water the plant weekly or whenever its exposed roots turn silvery white (about once a week). Run warm water over the plant, bark, and aerial roots three or four times over the course of about 10 minutes, giving the orchid plenty of time for absorption. Then, make sure it's completely drained before you return it back to its window. Water should never be allowed to rest around the stem of the plant. This will cause the new leaves to rot, and the plant will die.
